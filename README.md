Employee Leave & Attendance Management System using Salesforce
1. Problem Statement
In many organizations, the leave and attendance management process is manual and error-prone:
•	Employees face delays in leave approvals.
•	Managers struggle to monitor leave requests and attendance records.
•	HR teams lack real-time visibility into leave balances and departmental reports.
This results in delayed approvals, inaccurate leave balances, and reduced employee satisfaction.
